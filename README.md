# A Sudoku Solver in Rust

This project is an attempt to familiarize myself with Rust in terms of both the
language itself, patterns and workspaces. To do something at least remotely meaningful,
it implements a Sudoku solver.

## Build an run

To build and run, execute

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Example Puzzle

For reference, here's an example puzzle from the Wikipedia [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) page:
